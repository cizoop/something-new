# something-new
this is a project i made ,this idea came into my head while i learning css,javascript,html. i was just going with the flow while an idea clicked it was to  make something simple sweet silly web page and this project clearly shows how simple method of math.random(), Math.floor(Math.random())- floor helps in rounding off the decimal numbers ,helps in getting exact integer value. can be used in generating color and its a great way to implement certain things i learned.
whoever reading this i hope u have a good day..
